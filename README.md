# Bloggy

Bloggy is a blog prototype website created with AngularJS. It contains many features :

- Main page displaying the article list and detailed page for each article, with data stored on an external API
- Admin panel allowing management of article list (add, edit & delete) with dynamic forms, by interacting with external API
- Responsive website (for most pages)
- Error handling

```This repository consists of the src folder, therefore it requires the Angular environment components to work properly.```
